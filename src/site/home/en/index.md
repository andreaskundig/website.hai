      Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and people keen to
      understand privacy in relationships formed online. The collective is
      worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and exposed online.
      We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps, understand the
      privacy problems they create, and work to improve data literacy.

      We want to understand many privacy risks that we, as dating app users, are
      confronted with when looking for a date online: unwanted ads,
      discrimination resulting from data, incorrect profiling and predictions,
      and the possibility of phishing and identity theft by rogue users.
