  - title: How much is your attention worth?
    description: >-
      Every second you spend online, thousands of sensors track your behaviour.
      The best data experts have designed them to profile you and design the
      message, the image, the video likely to arouse your interest. By any means
      necessary.

      ```


      To get your attention, advertisers have spent over US$375 billion on digital media in 2020 alone.

      "No way. I'm not. The influenced ones are the conspiracists and the kids
      on Instagram, not me." Don't be so sure.

    description: >-
      We are looking to collaborate with journalists, academics, researchers,
      activists and NGOs in data protection and other related themes.


      We push ideas for better user and company practices to control personal data and date safely online. We are particularly interested in raising awareness, as well as building methodological protocols and privacy tools for data protection and literacy.
