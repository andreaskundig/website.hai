      Every second you spend online, thousands of sensors track your behaviour.
      The best data experts have designed them to profile you and design the
      message, the image, the video likely to arouse your interest. By any means
      necessary.

      To get your attention, advertisers have spent over US$375 billion on digital media in 2020 alone.

      Dating Privacy is you and me: dating app users and people keen to
      understand privacy in relationships formed online. The collective is
      worried about the way our intimate life is being coded and exposed online.
      We aim to retake control of personal data on dating apps, understand the
      privacy problems they create, and work to improve data literacy.
