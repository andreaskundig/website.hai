Hello, my name is Charles Foucault-Dumas, I'm 39 years old and have very few qualities other than curiosity. So when HestiaLabs, for whom I work, decided to support The Eyeballs initiative by developing software tools capable of revealing the fingerprints (ah ah) that each of us leaves online and how they are used to convince us (to buy this, to vote for that...), I immediately raised my finger.

* Yes Charles?
* Can I try?
* Do you want to be a beta tester for The Eyeballs?
* Yes, I do. Come on. Chop, chop, chop.
* Well, yeah, okay. Where would you like to start? 
* Twitter, it's the network I use the most.
* So here we go.

The very next day (see thread below), I learned (not without a little pride) that I was a woman and that I spoke German. I also discovered my interest in the footballer Jérémie Boga (whom I didn't know existed), my passion for Land Rovers (???) and my immoderate taste for milk (I never drink it).

But all this is just the tip of the iceberg. Twitter knows a lot more about me than that. The Eyeballs team is currently developing the software tools to reveal all the things we don't see: why I am the ideal target for this or that advertising campaign. Why I am likely to adhere to this message, to click on this video. All this will be ready soon and will be the subject of a future post...
