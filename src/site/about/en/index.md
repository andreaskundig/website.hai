  When mathematician Paul-Olivier Dehaye discovered what Cambridge Analytica was
  doing with Facebook users' data to influence their votes, he did a hell of a
  job that led to the [Facebook-Cambridge Analytica
  affair](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump)
  and the making of the Netflix movie [The Great
  Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Hack).


  “Paul-Olivier Dehaye is now one of the world's leading experts on this issue”, [wrote Paris-Match](https://paris-match.ch/labecedaire-de-paul-olivier-dehaye/). Rather than selling his skills to the highest bidder, he convinced talented people to join him in the Hestia.ai adventure.


  Their goal: offer concrete solutions and intelligent support to companies understanding that trust is the new digital Eldorado.


  Their motto: User first. Privacy by design. No compromise.
