story: >-
  The Eyeballs brings together all those who have accepted to face the truth:
  the slightest of our online behavior is analyzed, monitored and sold.


  Members of our community act, discuss and help each other to understand how and by whom their data is being used against them.


  They confront this reality rather than suffer from it, compare their results and denounce algorithmic bias.


  You can't change anything by burying your head in the sand.
