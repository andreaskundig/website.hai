# Your data speaks for you

You've already received an ad that convinced you that your phone is listening, right?

[The (no less creepy) reality](https://qz.com/1609356/your-phone-is-not-recording-your-conversations/) is that everything you do online says more about you than you can imagine.

Thanks to your clicks, likes, how fast you click or scroll, who you chat with, what your friends are doing, where you go... platforms create a digital twin of you that is truer than life.

They are able to simulate the conversation you are having. They are able to know that you will change jobs in 6 months. Before you know it yourself.

To meet your digital self and understand how you are being targeted, download all the footprints you left online ⤵️

We will then explain your "targetingValue" (examples: interested in politics, likes sports, speaks English, lives in Zurich, follows @U2 on Twitter...). Suddenly, everything will become clear and you'll be able to compare your results with those of your friends.

Please note: for easier understanding of what this data represents, we also maintain a freely accessible [data catalog](/en/act/catalog/).
