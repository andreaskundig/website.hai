# Your data speaks for you

You've already received an ad that convinced you that your phone is listening, right?

[The (no less creepy) reality](https://qz.com/1609356/your-phone-is-not-recording-your-conversations/) is that everything you do online says more about you than you can imagine.

Thanks to your clicks, likes, how fast you click or scroll, who you chat with, what your friends are doing, where you go... platforms create a digital twin of you that is truer than life.

They are able to simulate the conversation you are having. They are able to know that you will change jobs in 6 months. Before you know it yourself.
