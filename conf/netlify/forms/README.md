# `conf/netlify/forms/*.html` ⟶ `/admin/forms/`

Netlify Forms explicit definitions, as static HTML files,
automatically picked up by the buildbots of Netlify —
wherever they would be in the website.

The `*.html` files will be copied to the `build/11ty/admin/forms/`
folder by Eleventy and published at the `admin/forms/` URL
(see [.eleventy.js](../../../.eleventy.js)).

⚠️ We are using two strategies to define the forms:

1. static definitions found in this folder, as explicit static
   HTML files, such as the ‹Newsletter sign-up› form;
2. form definitions generated by Eleventy during its build,
   such as the ‹Contact› forms, associated to the `contact` layout.
